Metric:
Goal: ensure that code is easily understandable so that when roles change in depth explaination is not required
Question: How large are our methods/how well are they documented?
Proxy measure: For each method created for the project:
        1) all methods should be documented as to their function
        2) methods should be kept at or under 15 lines.  
            *if addition lines are completely necessary thenthe documentation must more or less provide 
            a walkthrough of every detail in that method
            ** tests that go over 15 lines of code are allowed as long as they are also well documented
Data collection: use Eclipse metrics plug in to check the number of lines of code per method.  Overages will be ignored if the above (*) condition is met.
